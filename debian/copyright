 1. General; Definitions. This License applies to any program or other
 work which Apple Computer, Inc. ("Apple") makes publicly available and
 which contains a notice placed by Apple identifying such program or
 work as "Original Code" and stating that it is subject to the terms of

 1.1 "Applicable Patent Rights" mean: (a) in the case where Apple is
 the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter
 acquired, owned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) that cover subject
 matter contained in the Original Code, but only to the extent
 necessary to use, reproduce and/or distribute the Original Code
 without infringement; and (b) in the case where You are the grantor of
 rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired,
 owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in Your
 Modifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code.
 .
 1.2 "Contributor" means any person or entity that creates or
 contributes to the creation of Modifications.
 .
 1.3 "Covered Code" means the Original Code, Modifications, the

 otherwise make Covered Code available, directly or indirectly, to
 anyone other than You; and/or (b) to use Covered Code, alone or as
 part of a Larger Work, in any way to provide a service, including but
 not limited to delivery of content, through electronic communication
 with a client other than You.
 .
 1.5 "Larger Work" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions
 thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.
 .
 1.6 "Modifications" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change
 to, the substance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous
 Modifications, the combination of Original Code and any previous
 Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof. When code is
 released as a series of files, a Modification is: (a) any addition to
 or deletion from the contents of a file containing Covered Code;
 and/or (b) any new file or other representation of computer program
 statements that contains any part of Covered Code.
 .
 1.7 "Original Code" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other
 work as originally made available by Apple under this License,
 including the Source Code of any updates or upgrades to such programs
 or works made available by Apple under this License, and that has been
 expressly identified by Apple as such in the header file(s) of such
 work; and (b) the object code compiled from such Source Code and
 originally made available by Apple under this License.
 .
 1.8 "Source Code" means the human readable form of a program or other
 work that is suitable for making modifications to it, including all
 modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
 scripts used to control compilation and installation of an executable
 (object code).
 .
 1.9 "You" or "Your" means an individual or a legal entity exercising
 rights under this License. For legal entities, "You" or "Your"
 includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under
 common control with, You, where "control" means (a) the power, direct
 or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
 whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent
 (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of
 such entity.
 .
 2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms
 and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on
 the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a
 world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of
 Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original
 Code, to do the following:
 .
 2.1 Unmodified Code. You may use, reproduce, display, perform,
 internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy
 verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or
 non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance:
 .
 (a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the
 copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as
 they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the
 Original Code that refer to this License; and
 .
 (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source
 Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally
 Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code
 that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights
 hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.
 .
 2.2 Modified Code. You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce,
 display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and
 Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial
 or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also
 meet all of these conditions:
 .
 (a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to
 the Source Code of the Covered Code;
 .
 (b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the
 notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your
 Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
 stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and
 .
 this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3
 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve
 (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is
 longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your
 Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a
 web site).
 .
 2.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You
 Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in
 object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent
 notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation,
 stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the
 terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such
 Source Code.
 .
 2.4 Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that
 although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their
 respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no
 assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered
 Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
 rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any
 liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on
 infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
 condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You
 hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
 property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
 license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is
 Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the
 Covered Code.
 .
 3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the
 licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any
 person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this
 License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license,
 under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property
 rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use,
 reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and
 Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as
 Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.
 .
 4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered
 Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
 distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance,
 You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
 the Covered Code or any portion thereof.
 .
 5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in
 Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by
 Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional
 patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole
 discretion.
 .
 6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
 warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other
 rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein
 ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
 However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole
 responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You
 must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms
 are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend
 and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability
 incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by
 reason of any such Additional Terms.
 .
 7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new
 versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given
 a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published
 under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it
 under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
 Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this
 License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to
 modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
 License.
 .
 8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in
 part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered
 Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and
 may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge
 and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at
 Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND
 WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND
 APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE" FOR THE
 PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
 ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
 NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF
 MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD
 PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST
 INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE
 FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS,
 THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR
 ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO
 ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE
 AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.
 You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the
 operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication
 systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of
 the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe
 physical or environmental damage.
 .
 9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO
 EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,
 SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
 TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR
 ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY,
 TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF
 APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY
 REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF
 INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
 TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all
 damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this
 License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).
 .
 10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the
 trademarks or trade names "Apple", "Apple Computer", "Mac", "Mac OS",
 "QuickTime", "QuickTime Streaming Server" or any other trademarks,
 service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively
 "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name
 belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use any Apple Marks in
 or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or
 to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other
 than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times
 with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted
 at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.
 .
 11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License,
 each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any
 Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights,
 title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications
 made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple
 Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple
 may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple
 Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those
 contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.
 .
 12. Termination.
 .
 12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
 terminate:
 .
 (a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with
 any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30
 days of becoming aware of such breach;
 .
 (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section
 13.5(b); or
 .
 12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately
 stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and
 distribution of the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code
 which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive
 any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature,
 should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
 survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11,
 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation,
 indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating
 this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this
 License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of
 any party.
 .
 13. Miscellaneous.
 .
 13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as
 defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in
 the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the
 public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license
 in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR
 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for
 Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data --
 Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer
 Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S.
 Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set
 forth herein.
 .
 13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as
 creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of
 legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and
 You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by
 implication, appearance or otherwise.
 .
 13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair
 Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for
 it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the
 same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with,
 Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may
 develop, produce, market or distribute.
 .
 13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to
 enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of
 future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or
 regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
 construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.
 .
 13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent
 jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof,
 to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to
 the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits
 and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will
 continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing,
 if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or
 specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the
 enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will
 immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of
 the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your
 possession or control.
 .
 13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution
 between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the
 Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to
 the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal
 courts within that District with respect to this License. The
 application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
 International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
 .
 13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the
 entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject
 matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the
 United States and the State of California, except that body of
 California law concerning conflicts of law.
 .
 Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following
 clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested
 that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les
 parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents
 connexes soient rediges en anglais.

License: Clarified-Artistic
 The "Clarified Artistic License"
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
 Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
 while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
 the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
 reasonable modifications.
 .
 Definitions:
 - "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
   Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
   created through textual modification.
 .
 - "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
   modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
   of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
 .
 - "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
   copyrights for the package.
 .
 - "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
   this Package.
 .
 - "Distribution fee" is a fee you charge for providing a copy of this
   Package to another party.
 .
 - "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the right to use
   the item, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
 .
 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
 duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
 .
 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
 derived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from
 the Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be
 considered the Standard Version.
 .
 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
 that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
 when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
 following:
 .
     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
     Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
     an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
     site allowing unrestricted access to them, or by allowing the Copyright
     Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the
     Package.
 .
     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
 .
     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
     with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
     a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
     documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
 .
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
     e) permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified Package
     permission to make your modifications Freely Available in some specific
     way.
 .
 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
 executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
     together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
     to get the Standard Version.
 .
     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
     the Package with your modifications.
 .
     c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
     document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
     with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
 .
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
     e) offer the machine-readable source of the Package, with your
     modifications, by mail order.
 .
 5. You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution of this Package.
 If you offer support for this Package, you may charge any fee you choose
 for that support.  You may not charge a license fee for the right to use
 this Package itself.  You may distribute this Package in aggregate with
 other (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) programs as part of a
 larger (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) software distribution,
 and charge license fees for other parts of that software distribution,
 provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.
 If the Package includes an interpreter, You may embed this Package's
 interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be
 construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete
 Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.
 .
 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
 output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
 under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
 them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
 Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
 Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
 binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
 neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
 fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
 not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
 Package.
 .
 7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
 languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
 emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
 Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
 equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
 not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
 regression tests for the language.
 .
 8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial
 distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is
 embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's
 interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.
 Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.
 .
 9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
 products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
 .
 10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
